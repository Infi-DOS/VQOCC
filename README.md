# VQOCC
This is an implementation of the Variational Quantum One Class Classifier based on the Paper:
* (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/acafd5)

The main Idea is to create this model available to many quantum libraries:
* Classiq
* Qiskit
* Pennylane

Will follow exactly the paper and the code that is provided: https://github.com/Quantumgunhee/VQOCC
